# Note: In the QA/ACP environment we use the /release branch to test before merging to master
#       Projects without /release branches may need to have them created an this QA settings file updated to
#       point to /release for that project (/release branches should be created from /master and anything
#       that needs testing should be merged into /release from /develop so it is ready for acceptance testing)
